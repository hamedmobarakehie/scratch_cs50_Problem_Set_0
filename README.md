This scratch for cs50 Problem Set 0

This  displays a road with several cars passing by. At the beginning, it asks for your name and then shows your name next to a star in the sky.
At the start, the sound of traffic plays. Once it stops, the "Tararara Trumpet" sound plays, and the text "CS50" appears next to the star.
